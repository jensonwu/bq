This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.71, last updated 19 July 2010,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.82.

<h3 class="section">14.2 Utilities in Makefiles</h3>

<p>Write the Makefile commands (and any shell scripts, such as
<code>configure</code>) to run under <code>sh</code> (both the traditional Bourne
shell and the <span class="sc">posix</span> shell), not <code>csh</code>.  Don't use any
special features of <code>ksh</code> or <code>bash</code>, or <span class="sc">posix</span> features
not widely supported in traditional Bourne <code>sh</code>.

   <p>The <code>configure</code> script and the Makefile rules for building and
installation should not use any utilities directly except these:

<!-- dd find -->
<!-- gunzip gzip md5sum -->
<!-- mkfifo mknod tee uname -->
<pre class="example">     awk cat cmp cp diff echo egrep expr false grep install-info ln ls
     mkdir mv printf pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch tr true
</pre>
   <p>Compression programs such as <code>gzip</code> can be used in the
<code>dist</code> rule.

   <p>Generally, stick to the widely-supported (usually
<span class="sc">posix</span>-specified) options and features of these programs.  For
example, don't use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mkdir -p</span></samp>&rsquo;, convenient as it may be, because a
few systems don't support it at all and with others, it is not safe
for parallel execution.  For a list of known incompatibilities, see
<a href="../autoconf/Portable-Shell.html#Portable-Shell">Portable Shell Programming</a>.

   <p>It is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles, since a
few file systems don't support them.

   <p>The Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers
and related programs, but should do so via <code>make</code> variables so that the
user can substitute alternatives.  Here are some of the programs we
mean:

<pre class="example">     ar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex
     make makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc
</pre>
   <p>Use the following <code>make</code> variables to run those programs:

<pre class="example">     $(AR) $(BISON) $(CC) $(FLEX) $(INSTALL) $(LD) $(LDCONFIG) $(LEX)
     $(MAKE) $(MAKEINFO) $(RANLIB) $(TEXI2DVI) $(YACC)
</pre>
   <p>When you use <code>ranlib</code> or <code>ldconfig</code>, you should make sure
nothing bad happens if the system does not have the program in question. 
Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before
the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean
a problem.  (The Autoconf &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AC_PROG_RANLIB</span></samp>&rsquo; macro can help with
this.)

   <p>If you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for systems
that don't have symbolic links.

   <p>Additional utilities that can be used via Make variables are:

<pre class="example">     chgrp chmod chown mknod
</pre>
   <p>It is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts)
intended only for particular systems where you know those utilities
exist.
