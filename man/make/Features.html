<h2 class="chapter">12 Features of GNU <code>make</code></h2>

<p><a name="index-features-of-GNU-_0040code_007bmake_007d-1018"></a><a name="index-portability-1019"></a><a name="index-compatibility-1020"></a>
Here is a summary of the features of GNU <code>make</code>, for comparison
with and credit to other versions of <code>make</code>.  We consider the
features of <code>make</code> in 4.2 BSD systems as a baseline.  If you are
concerned with writing portable makefiles, you should not use the
features of <code>make</code> listed here, nor the ones in <a href="Missing.html#Missing">Missing</a>.

   <p>Many features come from the version of <code>make</code> in System V.

     <ul>
<li>The <code>VPATH</code> variable and its special meaning. 
See <a href="Directory-Search.html#Directory-Search">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</a>. 
This feature exists in System V <code>make</code>, but is undocumented. 
It is documented in 4.3 BSD <code>make</code> (which says it mimics System V's
<code>VPATH</code> feature).

     <li>Included makefiles.  See <a href="Include.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>. 
Allowing multiple files to be included with a single directive is a GNU
extension.

     <li>Variables are read from and communicated via the environment. 
See <a href="Environment.html#Environment">Variables from the Environment</a>.

     <li>Options passed through the variable <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> to recursive
invocations of <code>make</code>. 
See <a href="Options_002fRecursion.html#Options_002fRecursion">Communicating Options to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>.

     <li>The automatic variable <code>$%</code> is set to the member name
in an archive reference.  See <a href="Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.

     <li>The automatic variables <code>$@</code>, <code>$*</code>, <code>$&lt;</code>, <code>$%</code>,
and <code>$?</code> have corresponding forms like <code>$(@F)</code> and
<code>$(@D)</code>.  We have generalized this to <code>$^</code> as an obvious
extension.  See <a href="Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.

     <li>Substitution variable references. 
See <a href="Reference.html#Reference">Basics of Variable References</a>.

     <li>The command line options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-b</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo;, accepted and
ignored.  In System V <code>make</code>, these options actually do something.

     <li>Execution of recursive commands to run <code>make</code> via the variable
<code>MAKE</code> even if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo; is specified. 
See <a href="Recursion.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>.

     <li>Support for suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.a</span></samp>&rsquo; in suffix rules.  See <a href="Archive-Suffix-Rules.html#Archive-Suffix-Rules">Archive Suffix Rules</a>.  This feature is obsolete in GNU <code>make</code>, because the
general feature of rule chaining (see <a href="Chained-Rules.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>) allows one pattern rule for installing members in an
archive (see <a href="Archive-Update.html#Archive-Update">Archive Update</a>) to be sufficient.

     <li>The arrangement of lines and backslash-newline combinations in
recipes is retained when the recipes are printed, so they appear as
they do in the makefile, except for the stripping of initial
whitespace. 
</ul>

   <p>The following features were inspired by various other versions of
<code>make</code>.  In some cases it is unclear exactly which versions inspired
which others.

     <ul>
<li>Pattern rules using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This has been implemented in several versions of <code>make</code>. 
We're not sure who invented it first, but it's been spread around a bit. 
See <a href="Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</a>.

     <li>Rule chaining and implicit intermediate files. 
This was implemented by Stu Feldman in his version of <code>make</code>
for AT&amp;T Eighth Edition Research Unix, and later by Andrew Hume of
AT&amp;T Bell Labs in his <code>mk</code> program (where he terms it
&ldquo;transitive closure&rdquo;).  We do not really know if
we got this from either of them or thought it up ourselves at the
same time.  See <a href="Chained-Rules.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.

     <li>The automatic variable <code>$^</code> containing a list of all prerequisites
of the current target.  We did not invent this, but we have no idea who
did.  See <a href="Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</a>.  The automatic variable
<code>$+</code> is a simple extension of <code>$^</code>.

     <li>The &ldquo;what if&rdquo; flag (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo; in GNU <code>make</code>) was (as far as we know)
invented by Andrew Hume in <code>mk</code>. 
See <a href="Instead-of-Execution.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>.

     <li>The concept of doing several things at once (parallelism) exists in
many incarnations of <code>make</code> and similar programs, though not in the
System V or BSD implementations.  See <a href="Execution.html#Execution">Recipe Execution</a>.

     <li>Modified variable references using pattern substitution come from
SunOS 4.  See <a href="Reference.html#Reference">Basics of Variable References</a>. 
This functionality was provided in GNU <code>make</code> by the
<code>patsubst</code> function before the alternate syntax was implemented
for compatibility with SunOS 4.  It is not altogether clear who
inspired whom, since GNU <code>make</code> had <code>patsubst</code> before SunOS
4 was released.

     <li>The special significance of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; characters preceding recipe lines
(see <a href="Instead-of-Execution.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>) is
mandated by <cite>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</cite> (POSIX.2).

     <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+=</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax to append to the value of a variable comes from SunOS
4 <code>make</code>.  See <a href="Appending.html#Appending">Appending More Text to Variables</a>.

     <li>The syntax &lsquo;<samp><var>archive</var><span class="samp">(</span><var>mem1</var><span class="samp">&nbsp;</span><var>mem2</var><span class="samp">...)</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> to list
multiple members in a single archive file comes from SunOS 4 <code>make</code>. 
See <a href="Archive-Members.html#Archive-Members">Archive Members</a>.

     <li>The <code>-include</code> directive to include makefiles with no error for a
nonexistent file comes from SunOS 4 <code>make</code>.  (But note that SunOS 4
<code>make</code> does not allow multiple makefiles to be specified in one
<code>-include</code> directive.)  The same feature appears with the name
<code>sinclude</code> in SGI <code>make</code> and perhaps others. 
</ul>

   <p>The remaining features are inventions new in GNU <code>make</code>:

     <ul>
<li>Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-v</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--version</span></samp>&rsquo; option to print version and
copyright information.

     <li>Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-h</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--help</span></samp>&rsquo; option to summarize the options to
<code>make</code>.

     <li>Simply-expanded variables.  See <a href="Flavors.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</a>.

     <li>Pass command line variable assignments automatically through the
variable <code>MAKE</code> to recursive <code>make</code> invocations. 
See <a href="Recursion.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>.

     <li>Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-C</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--directory</span></samp>&rsquo; command option to change
directory.  See <a href="Options-Summary.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>.

     <li>Make verbatim variable definitions with <code>define</code>. 
See <a href="Multi_002dLine.html#Multi_002dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>.

     <li>Declare phony targets with the special target <code>.PHONY</code>.

     <p>Andrew Hume of AT&amp;T Bell Labs implemented a similar feature with a
different syntax in his <code>mk</code> program.  This seems to be a case of
parallel discovery.  See <a href="Phony-Targets.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>.

     <li>Manipulate text by calling functions. 
See <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions for Transforming Text</a>.

     <li>Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-o</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--old-file</span></samp>&rsquo;
option to pretend a file's modification-time is old. 
See <a href="Avoiding-Compilation.html#Avoiding-Compilation">Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files</a>.

     <li>Conditional execution.

     <p>This feature has been implemented numerous times in various versions
of <code>make</code>; it seems a natural extension derived from the features
of the C preprocessor and similar macro languages and is not a
revolutionary concept.  See <a href="Conditionals.html#Conditionals">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</a>.

     <li>Specify a search path for included makefiles. 
See <a href="Include.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>.

     <li>Specify extra makefiles to read with an environment variable. 
See <a href="MAKEFILES-Variable.html#MAKEFILES-Variable">The Variable <code>MAKEFILES</code></a>.

     <li>Strip leading sequences of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./</span></samp>&rsquo; from file names, so that
<samp><span class="file">./</span><var>file</var></samp> and <samp><var>file</var></samp> are considered to be the
same file.

     <li>Use a special search method for library prerequisites written in the
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
See <a href="Libraries_002fSearch.html#Libraries_002fSearch">Directory Search for Link Libraries</a>.

     <li>Allow suffixes for suffix rules
(see <a href="Suffix-Rules.html#Suffix-Rules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>) to contain any
characters.  In other versions of <code>make</code>, they must begin with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; and not contain any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; characters.

     <li>Keep track of the current level of <code>make</code> recursion using the
variable <code>MAKELEVEL</code>.  See <a href="Recursion.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>.

     <li>Provide any goals given on the command line in the variable
<code>MAKECMDGOALS</code>.  See <a href="Goals.html#Goals">Arguments to Specify the Goals</a>.

     <li>Specify static pattern rules.  See <a href="Static-Pattern.html#Static-Pattern">Static Pattern Rules</a>.

     <li>Provide selective <code>vpath</code> search. 
See <a href="Directory-Search.html#Directory-Search">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</a>.

     <li>Provide computed variable references. 
See <a href="Reference.html#Reference">Basics of Variable References</a>.

     <li>Update makefiles.  See <a href="Remaking-Makefiles.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</a>. 
System V <code>make</code> has a very, very limited form of this
functionality in that it will check out SCCS files for makefiles.

     <li>Various new built-in implicit rules. 
See <a href="Catalogue-of-Rules.html#Catalogue-of-Rules">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</a>.

     <li>The built-in variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MAKE_VERSION</span></samp>&rsquo; gives the version number of
<code>make</code>.
