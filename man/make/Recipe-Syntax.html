automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Recipe Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-recipe-syntax-288"></a><a name="index-syntax-of-recipe-289"></a>
Makefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct
syntaxes in one file.  Most of the makefile uses <code>make</code> syntax
(see <a href="Makefiles.html#Makefiles">Writing Makefiles</a>).  However, recipes are meant
to be interpreted by the shell and so they are written using shell
syntax.  The <code>make</code> program does not try to understand shell
syntax: it performs only a very few specific translations on the
content of the recipe before handing it to the shell.

   <p>Each line in the recipe must start with a tab (or the first character
in the value of the <code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable; see <a href="Special-Variables.html#Special-Variables">Special Variables</a>), except that the first recipe line may be attached to the
target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between.  <em>Any</em>
line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a &ldquo;rule
context&rdquo; (that is, after a rule has been started until another rule
or variable definition) will be considered part of a recipe for that
rule.  Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear among the
recipe lines; they are ignored.

   <p>Some consequences of these rules include:

     <ul>
<li>A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it's an empty
recipe (see <a href="Empty-Recipes.html#Empty-Recipes">Empty Recipes</a>).

     <p><a name="index-comments_002c-in-recipes-290"></a><a name="index-recipes_002c-comments-in-291"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023_007d-_0028comments_0029_002c-in-recipes-292"></a><li>A comment in a recipe is not a <code>make</code> comment; it will be
passed to the shell as-is.  Whether the shell treats it as a comment
or not depends on your shell.

     <li>A variable definition in a &ldquo;rule context&rdquo; which is indented by a tab
as the first character on the line, will be considered part of a
recipe, not a <code>make</code> variable definition, and passed to the
shell.

     <li>A conditional expression (<code>ifdef</code>, <code>ifeq</code>,
etc. see <a href="Conditional-Syntax.html#Conditional-Syntax">Syntax of Conditionals</a>) in a &ldquo;rule
context&rdquo; which is indented by a tab as the first character on the
line, will be considered part of a recipe and be passed to the shell.
