automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Using One Shell</h4>

<p><a name="index-recipe-lines_002c-single-shell-322"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002eONESHELL_007d_002c-use-of-323"></a><a name="index-g_t_002eONESHELL-324"></a>
Sometimes you would prefer that all the lines in the recipe be passed
to a single invocation of the shell.  There are generally two
situations where this is useful: first, it can improve performance in
makefiles where recipes consist of many command lines, by avoiding
extra processes.  Second, you might want newlines to be included in
your recipe command (for example perhaps you are using a very
different interpreter as your <code>SHELL</code>).  If the <code>.ONESHELL</code>
special target appears anywhere in the makefile then <em>all</em>
recipe lines for each target will be provided to a single invocation
of the shell.  Newlines between recipe lines will be preserved.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     .ONESHELL:
     foo : bar/lose
             cd $(@D)
             gobble $(@F) &gt; ../$@
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would now work as expected even though the commands are on different
recipe lines.

   <p>If <code>.ONESHELL</code> is provided, then only the first line of the
recipe will be checked for the special prefix characters (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;).  Subsequent lines will include the special
characters in the recipe line when the <code>SHELL</code> is invoked.  If
you want your recipe to start with one of these special characters
you'll need to arrange for them to not be the first characters on the
first line, perhaps by adding a comment or similar.  For example, this
would be a syntax error in Perl because the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; is removed
by make:

<pre class="example">     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
     show :
             @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">However, either of these alternatives would work properly:

<pre class="example">     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
     show :
             # Make sure "@" is not the first character on the first line
             @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
     show :
             my @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</pre>
   <p>As a special feature, if <code>SHELL</code> is determined to be a
POSIX-style shell, the special prefix characters in &ldquo;internal&rdquo;
recipe lines will <em>removed</em> before the recipe is processed.  This
feature is intended to allow existing makefiles to add the
<code>.ONESHELL</code> special target and still run properly without
extensive modifications.  Since the special prefix characters are not
legal at the beginning of a line in a POSIX shell script this is not a
loss in functionality.  For example, this works as expected:

<pre class="example">     .ONESHELL:
     foo : bar/lose
             @cd $(@D)
             @gobble $(@F) &gt; ../$@
</pre>
   <p>Even with this special feature, however, makefiles with
<code>.ONESHELL</code> will behave differently in ways that could be
noticeable.  For example, normally if any line in the recipe fails,
that causes the rule to fail and no more recipe lines are processed. 
Under <code>.ONESHELL</code> a failure of any but the final recipe line will
not be noticed by <code>make</code>.  You can modify <code>.SHELLFLAGS</code> to
add the <code>-e</code> option to the shell which will cause any failure
anywhere in the command line to cause the shell to fail, but this
could itself cause your recipe to behave differently.  Ultimately you
may need to harden your recipe lines to allow them to work with
<code>.ONESHELL</code>.
