This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.82.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Types of Prerequisites</h3>

<p><a name="index-prerequisite-types-140"></a><a name="index-types-of-prerequisites-141"></a>
<a name="index-prerequisites_002c-normal-142"></a><a name="index-normal-prerequisites-143"></a><a name="index-prerequisites_002c-order_002donly-144"></a><a name="index-order_002donly-prerequisites-145"></a>There are actually two different types of prerequisites understood by
GNU <code>make</code>: normal prerequisites such as described in the
previous section, and <dfn>order-only</dfn> prerequisites.  A normal
prerequisite makes two statements: first, it imposes an order in which
recipes will be invoked: the recipes for all prerequisites of a target
will be completed before the recipe for the target is run.  Second, it
imposes a dependency relationship: if any prerequisite is newer than
the target, then the target is considered out-of-date and must be
rebuilt.

   <p>Normally, this is exactly what you want: if a target's prerequisite is
updated, then the target should also be updated.

   <p>Occasionally, however, you have a situation where you want to impose a
specific ordering on the rules to be invoked <em>without</em> forcing
the target to be updated if one of those rules is executed.  In that
case, you want to define <dfn>order-only</dfn> prerequisites.  Order-only
prerequisites can be specified by placing a pipe symbol (<code>|</code>)
in the prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the pipe
symbol are normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only:

<pre class="example">     <var>targets</var> : <var>normal-prerequisites</var> | <var>order-only-prerequisites</var>
</pre>
   <p>The normal prerequisites section may of course be empty.  Also, you
may still declare multiple lines of prerequisites for the same target:
they are appended appropriately (normal prerequisites are appended to
the list of normal prerequisites; order-only prerequisites are
appended to the list of order-only prerequisites).  Note that if you
declare the same file to be both a normal and an order-only
prerequisite, the normal prerequisite takes precedence (since they
have a strict superset of the behavior of an order-only prerequisite).

   <p>Consider an example where your targets are to be placed in a separate
directory, and that directory might not exist before <code>make</code> is
run.  In this situation, you want the directory to be created before
any targets are placed into it but, because the timestamps on
directories change whenever a file is added, removed, or renamed, we
certainly don't want to rebuild all the targets whenever the
directory's timestamp changes.  One way to manage this is with
order-only prerequisites: make the directory an order-only
prerequisite on all the targets:

<pre class="example">     OBJDIR := objdir
     OBJS := $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/,foo.o bar.o baz.o)
     
     $(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
             $(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $&lt;
     
     all: $(OBJS)
     
     $(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)
     
     $(OBJDIR):
             mkdir $(OBJDIR)
</pre>
   <p>Now the rule to create the <samp><span class="file">objdir</span></samp> directory will be run, if
needed, before any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; is built, but no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; will be built
because the <samp><span class="file">objdir</span></samp> directory timestamp changed.
