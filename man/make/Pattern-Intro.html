automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h4 class="subsection">10.5.1 Introduction to Pattern Rules</h4>

<p><a name="index-pattern-rule-926"></a><a name="index-rule_002c-pattern-927"></a>
A pattern rule contains the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; (exactly one of them)
in the target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule.  The
target is a pattern for matching file names; the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any
nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves. 
<a name="index-target-pattern_002c-implicit-928"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0025_007d_002c-in-pattern-rules-929"></a>
For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%.c</span></samp>&rsquo; as a pattern matches any file name that ends in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s.%.c</span></samp>&rsquo; as a pattern matches any file name that starts
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">s.</span></samp>&rsquo;, ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; and is at least five characters long. 
(There must be at least one character to match the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;.)  The substring
that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; matches is called the <dfn>stem</dfn>.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem
that was matched by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; in the target.  In order for the
pattern rule to apply, its target pattern must match the file name
under consideration and all of its prerequisites (after pattern
substitution) must name files that exist or can be made.  These files
become prerequisites of the target. 
<a name="index-prerequisite-pattern_002c-implicit-930"></a>
Thus, a rule of the form

<pre class="example">     %.o : %.c ; <var>recipe</var>...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies how to make a file <samp><var>n</var><span class="file">.o</span></samp>, with another file
<samp><var>n</var><span class="file">.c</span></samp> as its prerequisite, provided that <samp><var>n</var><span class="file">.c</span></samp>
exists or can be made.

   <p>There may also be prerequisites that do not use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;; such a prerequisite
attaches to every file made by this pattern rule.  These unvarying
prerequisites are useful occasionally.

   <p>A pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
in fact any prerequisites at all.  Such a rule is effectively a general
wildcard.  It provides a way to make any file that matches the target
pattern.  See <a href="Last-Resort.html#Last-Resort">Last Resort</a>.

   <p>More than one pattern rule may match a target.  In this case
<code>make</code> will choose the &ldquo;best fit&rdquo; rule.  See <a href="Pattern-Match.html#Pattern-Match">How Patterns Match</a>.

<!-- !!! The end of of this paragraph should be rewritten.  -bob -->
   <p>Pattern rules may have more than one target.  Unlike normal rules,
this does not act as many different rules with the same prerequisites
and recipe.  If a pattern rule has multiple targets, <code>make</code> knows
that the rule's recipe is responsible for making all of the targets. 
The recipe is executed only once to make all the targets.  When
searching for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of
a rule other than the one that matches the target in need of a rule
are incidental: <code>make</code> worries only about giving a recipe and
prerequisites to the file presently in question.  However, when this
file's recipe is run, the other targets are marked as having been
updated themselves.
