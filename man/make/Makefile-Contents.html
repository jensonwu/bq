This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.71, last updated 19 July 2010,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.82.

<h3 class="section">3.1 What Makefiles Contain</h3>

<p>Makefiles contain five kinds of things: <dfn>explicit rules</dfn>,
<dfn>implicit rules</dfn>, <dfn>variable definitions</dfn>, <dfn>directives</dfn>,
and <dfn>comments</dfn>.  Rules, variables, and directives are described at
length in later chapters.

     
<a name="index-rule_002c-explicit_002c-definition-of-49"></a>
<a name="index-explicit-rule_002c-definition-of-50"></a>
<ul><li>An <dfn>explicit rule</dfn> says when and how to remake one or more files,
called the rule's <dfn>targets</dfn>.  It lists the other files that the
targets depend on, called the <dfn>prerequisites</dfn> of the target, and
may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets. 
See <a href="Rules.html#Rules">Writing Rules</a>.

     <p><a name="index-rule_002c-implicit_002c-definition-of-51"></a><a name="index-implicit-rule_002c-definition-of-52"></a><li>An <dfn>implicit rule</dfn> says when and how to remake a class of files
based on their names.  It describes how a target may depend on a file
with a name similar to the target and gives a recipe to create or
update such a target.  See <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>.

     <p><a name="index-variable-definition-53"></a><li>A <dfn>variable definition</dfn> is a line that specifies a text string
value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later.  The
simple makefile example shows a variable definition for <code>objects</code>
as a list of all object files (see <a href="Variables-Simplify.html#Variables-Simplify">Variables Make Makefiles Simpler</a>).

     <p><a name="index-directive-54"></a><li>A <dfn>directive</dfn> is an instruction for <code>make</code> to do something
special while reading the makefile.  These include:

          <ul>
<li>Reading another makefile (see <a href="Include.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>).

          <li>Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or
ignore a part of the makefile (see <a href="Conditionals.html#Conditionals">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</a>).

          <li>Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple lines
(see <a href="Multi_002dLine.html#Multi_002dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>). 
</ul>

     <p><a name="index-comments_002c-in-makefile-55"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023_007d-_0028comments_0029_002c-in-makefile-56"></a><li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; in a line of a makefile starts a <dfn>comment</dfn>.  It and the
rest of the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash not
escaped by another backslash will continue the comment across multiple
lines.  A line containing just a comment (with perhaps spaces before
it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.  If you want a literal
<code>#</code>, escape it with a backslash (e.g., <code>\#</code>).  Comments may
appear on any line in the makefile, although they are treated
specially in certain situations.

     <p>You cannot use comments within variable references or function calls:
any instance of <code>#</code> will be treated literally (rather than as the
start of a comment) inside a variable reference or function call.

     <p>Comments within a recipe are passed to the shell, just as with any
other recipe text.  The shell decides how to interpret it: whether or
not this is a comment is up to the shell.

     <p>Within a <code>define</code> directive, comments are not ignored during the
definition of the variable, but rather kept intact in the value of the
variable.  When the variable is expanded they will either be treated
as <code>make</code> comments or as recipe text, depending on the context in
which the variable is evaluated. 
</ul>
