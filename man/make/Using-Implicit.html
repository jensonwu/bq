<h3 class="section">10.1 Using Implicit Rules</h3>

<p><a name="index-implicit-rule_002c-how-to-use-789"></a><a name="index-rule_002c-implicit_002c-how-to-use-790"></a>
To allow <code>make</code> to find a customary method for updating a target
file, all you have to do is refrain from specifying recipes yourself. 
Either write a rule with no recipe, or don't write a rule at all. 
Then <code>make</code> will figure out which implicit rule to use based on
which kind of source file exists or can be made.

   <p>For example, suppose the makefile looks like this:

<pre class="example">     foo : foo.o bar.o
             cc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because you mention <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> but do not give a rule for it, <code>make</code>
will automatically look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it. 
This happens whether or not the file <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> currently exists.

   <p>If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both a recipe and one or
more prerequisites (the source files).  You would want to write a rule
for <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> with no recipe if you need to specify additional
prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot
supply.

   <p>Each implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns.  There may
be many implicit rules with the same target pattern.  For example, numerous
rules make &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files: one, from a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; file with the C compiler;
another, from a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.p</span></samp>&rsquo; file with the Pascal compiler; and so on.  The rule
that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites exist or can be made. 
So, if you have a file <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>, <code>make</code> will run the C compiler;
otherwise, if you have a file <samp><span class="file">foo.p</span></samp>, <code>make</code> will run the Pascal
compiler; and so on.

   <p>Of course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you
want <code>make</code> to use, and you know it will choose that one because you
know which possible prerequisite files are supposed to exist. 
See <a href="Catalogue-of-Rules.html#Catalogue-of-Rules">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</a>,
for a catalogue of all the predefined implicit rules.

   <p>Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites &ldquo;exist
or can be made&rdquo;.  A file &ldquo;can be made&rdquo; if it is mentioned explicitly in
the makefile as a target or a prerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be
recursively found for how to make it.  When an implicit prerequisite is the
result of another implicit rule, we say that <dfn>chaining</dfn> is occurring. 
See <a href="Chained-Rules.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.

   <p>In general, <code>make</code> searches for an implicit rule for each target, and
for each double-colon rule, that has no recipe.  A file that is mentioned
only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing,
so implicit rule search happens for it.  See <a href="Implicit-Rule-Search.html#Implicit-Rule-Search">Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</a>, for the
details of how the search is done.

   <p>Note that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule search. 
For example, consider this explicit rule:

<pre class="example">     foo.o: foo.p
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The prerequisite on <samp><span class="file">foo.p</span></samp> does not necessarily mean that
<code>make</code> will remake <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> according to the implicit rule to
make an object file, a <samp><span class="file">.o</span></samp> file, from a Pascal source file, a
<samp><span class="file">.p</span></samp> file.  For example, if <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> also exists, the implicit
rule to make an object file from a C source file is used instead,
because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined
implicit rules (see <a href="Catalogue-of-Rules.html#Catalogue-of-Rules">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</a>).

   <p>If you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no
recipe, you can give that target an empty recipe by writing a semicolon
(see <a href="Empty-Recipes.html#Empty-Recipes">Defining Empty Recipes</a>).
