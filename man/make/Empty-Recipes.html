<h3 class="section">5.9 Using Empty Recipes</h3>

<p><a name="index-empty-recipes-457"></a><a name="index-recipes_002c-empty-458"></a>
It is sometimes useful to define recipes which do nothing.  This is done
simply by giving a recipe that consists of nothing but whitespace.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     target: ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">defines an empty recipe for <samp><span class="file">target</span></samp>.  You could also use a line
beginning with a recipe prefix character to define an empty recipe,
but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002eDEFAULT_0040r_007b_002c-and-empty-recipes_007d-459"></a>You may be wondering why you would want to define a recipe that
does nothing.  The only reason this is useful is to prevent a target
from getting implicit recipes (from implicit rules or the
<code>.DEFAULT</code> special target; see <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Implicit Rules</a> and
see <a href="Last-Resort.html#Last-Resort">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</a>).

<!-- !!! another reason is for canonical stamp files: -->
   <p>You may be inclined to define empty recipes for targets that are
not actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be
remade.  However, this is not the best way to do that, because the
prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist. 
See <a href="Phony-Targets.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>, for a better way to do this.
