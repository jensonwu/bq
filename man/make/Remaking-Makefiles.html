automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h3 class="section">3.5 How Makefiles Are Remade</h3>

<p><a name="index-updating-makefiles-92"></a><a name="index-remaking-makefiles-93"></a><a name="index-makefile_002c-remaking-of-94"></a>Sometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS
files.  If a makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want
<code>make</code> to get an up-to-date version of the makefile to read in.

   <p>To this end, after reading in all makefiles, <code>make</code> will consider
each as a goal target and attempt to update it.  If a makefile has a
rule which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile or
in another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (see <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>), it will be updated if necessary.  After
all makefiles have been checked, if any have actually been changed,
<code>make</code> starts with a clean slate and reads all the makefiles over
again.  (It will also attempt to update each of them over again, but
normally this will not change them again, since they are already up to
date.)

   <p>If you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and
you want to keep <code>make</code> from performing an implicit rule search
on them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you can use any normal method
of preventing implicit rule lookup to do so.  For example, you can
write an explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty
recipe (see <a href="Empty-Recipes.html#Empty-Recipes">Using Empty Recipes</a>).

   <p>If the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with
a recipe but no prerequisites, that file will always be remade
(see <a href="Double_002dColon.html#Double_002dColon">Double-Colon</a>).  In the case of makefiles, a makefile that has a
double-colon rule with a recipe but no prerequisites will be remade every
time <code>make</code> is run, and then again after <code>make</code> starts over
and reads the makefiles in again.  This would cause an infinite loop:
<code>make</code> would constantly remake the makefile, and never do anything
else.  So, to avoid this, <code>make</code> will <strong>not</strong> attempt to
remake makefiles which are specified as targets of a double-colon rule
with a recipe but no prerequisites.

   <p>If you do not specify any makefiles to be read with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--file</span></samp>&rsquo; options, <code>make</code> will try the default makefile names;
see <a href="Makefile-Names.html#Makefile-Names">What Name to Give Your Makefile</a>.  Unlike
makefiles explicitly requested with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--file</span></samp>&rsquo; options,
<code>make</code> is not certain that these makefiles should exist.  However,
if a default makefile does not exist but can be created by running
<code>make</code> rules, you probably want the rules to be run so that the
makefile can be used.

   <p>Therefore, if none of the default makefiles exists, <code>make</code> will try
to make each of them in the same order in which they are searched for
(see <a href="Makefile-Names.html#Makefile-Names">What Name to Give Your Makefile</a>)
until it succeeds in making one, or it runs out of names to try.  Note
that it is not an error if <code>make</code> cannot find or make any makefile;
a makefile is not always necessary.

   <p>When you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--touch</span></samp>&rsquo; option
(see <a href="Instead-of-Execution.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</a>),
you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which
targets to touch.  So the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo; option has no effect on updating
makefiles; they are really updated even if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo; is specified. 
Likewise, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--question</span></samp>&rsquo;) and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--just-print</span></samp>&rsquo;) do not prevent updating of makefiles, because an
out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets. 
Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make -f mfile -n foo</span></samp>&rsquo; will update <samp><span class="file">mfile</span></samp>, read it in,
and then print the recipe to update <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> and its prerequisites
without running it.  The recipe printed for <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> will be the one
specified in the updated contents of <samp><span class="file">mfile</span></samp>.

   <p>However, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even
the makefiles.  You can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in
the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles.  When the
makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo;
and so on do apply to them.

   <p>Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make -f mfile -n mfile foo</span></samp>&rsquo; would read the makefile
<samp><span class="file">mfile</span></samp>, print the recipe needed to update it without actually
running it, and then print the recipe needed to update <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>
without running that.  The recipe for <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> will be the one
specified by the existing contents of <samp><span class="file">mfile</span></samp>.
