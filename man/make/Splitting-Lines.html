This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

One of the few ways in which <code>make</code> does interpret recipes is
checking for a backslash just before the newline.  As in normal
makefile syntax, a single logical recipe line can be split into
multiple physical lines in the makefile by placing a backslash before
each newline.  A sequence of lines like this is considered a single
recipe line, and one instance of the shell will be invoked to run it.

   <p>However, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a
makefile, backslash-newline pairs are <em>not</em> removed from the
recipe.  Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved
and passed to the shell.  How the backslash-newline is interpreted
depends on your shell.  If the first character of the next line after
the backslash-newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab by
default; see <a href="Special-Variables.html#Special-Variables">Special Variables</a>), then that character (and only
that character) is removed.  Whitespace is never added to the recipe.

   <p>For example, the recipe for the all target in this makefile:

<pre class="example">     all :
             @echo no\
     space
             @echo no\
             space
             @echo one \
             space
             @echo one\
              space
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">consists of four separate shell commands where the output is:

<pre class="example">     nospace
     nospace
     one space
     one space
</pre>
   <p>As a more complex example, this makefile:

<pre class="example">     all : ; @echo 'hello \
             world' ; echo "hello \
         world"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will invoke one shell with a command of:

<pre class="example">     echo 'hello \
     world' ; echo "hello \
         world"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which, according to shell quoting rules, will yield the following output:

<pre class="example">     hello \
     world
     hello     world
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice how the backslash/newline pair was removed inside the string
quoted with double quotes (<code>"..."</code>), but not from the string
quoted with single quotes (<code>'...'</code>).  This is the way the
default shell (<samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp>) handles backslash/newline pairs.  If
you specify a different shell in your makefiles it may treat them
differently.

   <p>Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but
you don't want the backslash-newline to appear in the quoted content. 
This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl,
where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning
or even be a syntax error.  One simple way of handling this is to
place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a
<code>make</code> variable then use the variable in the recipe.  In this
situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and
the backslash-newline will be removed.  If we rewrite our example
above using this method:

<pre class="example">     HELLO = 'hello \
     world'
     
     all : ; @echo $(HELLO)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">we will get output like this:

<pre class="example">     hello world
</pre>
   <p>If you like, you can also use target-specific variables
(see <a href="Target_002dspecific.html#Target_002dspecific">Target-specific Variable Values</a>) to obtain
a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that
uses it.
